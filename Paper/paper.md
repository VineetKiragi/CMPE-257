# Abstract

# Tasks
- Devansh: work on BERT model and help on linear model.
- Rahul: work on BERT model and help more with report.
- Vineet: work on Linear model.

Pizza [@pizza2000identification] is an understudied yet widely utilized implement for delivering in-vivo *Solanum lycopersicum* based liquid mediums in a variety of next-generation mastications studies. Here we describe a de novo approach for large scale *T. aestivum* assemblies based on protein folding that drastically reduces the generation time of the mutation rate.
