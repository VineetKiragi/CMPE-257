# Abstract

# Tasks
- Devansh: work on BERT model and help on linear model.
- Rahul: work on BERT model and help more with report.
- Vineet: work on Linear model.

Pizza [@pizza2000identification] is an understudied yet widely utilized implement for delivering in-vivo *Solanum lycopersicum* based liquid mediums in a variety of next-generation mastications studies. Here we describe a de novo approach for large scale *T. aestivum* assemblies based on protein folding that drastically reduces the generation time of the mutation rate.

# Introduction (Vineet)

# Methods (All)

## Vineet

## Applying BERT Uncased Whole Word Masking with Squad Benchmarking (Devansh)

In this method, I explore the following:
- What it means for BERT to achieve "human-level performance on question-answering"? 
- Is using BERT a powerful search technique for question-answering?

## Rahul

# Comparisons (Mainly linear vs BERT - Vineet/Devansh / Rahul for BERT comparison)

# Example Analysis (Devansh)

# Conclusions (Devansh)
