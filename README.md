## Dataset
We are using a dataset in SQUAD format. SQUAD datasets are a perfect fit to create a Question-Answer model. There are many SQUAD dataset readily available in on the internet, upon which we can implement our Quesion-Answering model. But we choose to take a pre existing dataset from [here](https://github.com/rajpurkar/SQuAD-explorer/tree/master/dataset) and make a new dataset of own by adding few more contexts and question using the Haystack Annotation tool [link](https://www.deepset.ai/annotation-tool-for-labeling-datasets).

Steps followed to create the Dataset

1. Use the same exisitng dataset from the above [link](https://github.com/rajpurkar/SQuAD-explorer/tree/master/dataset).
2. Add our own contexts and Questions and Answers using the above mentioned annotaion tool.
3. Export the dataset in SQUAD format which will be json file.
